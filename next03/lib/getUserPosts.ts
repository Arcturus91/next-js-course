//ISR : Incremental Static Regeneration.
//Next.js allows you to create or update static pages after youâ€™ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages
//ssg (static side generation)is the recommended way to fetch data for next.js. why? because it is faster than client side rendering. and it is more secure than server side rendering.
